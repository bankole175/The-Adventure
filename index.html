              what you offer to it. Outdoor adventure travel brings you closer
              to our world, its people, their culture, and their way of life. We
              don’t just offer the world. We offer you to the world.

              <p>
                Every to-be observer often wonders, Where do I begin?. Astronomy
                often is the hobby of looking at very distant object with a
                telescope... Unfortunately, for so many people, it ends with the
                skinny unused telescope offered as a kid for a birthday. Truth
                is, people rarely know what to look for. Don't start with a telescope, start with your own eyes. Star Gazing!

                A walk in nature walks the soul back home. Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you are climbing it.” “You're off to great places, today is your day. Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way. Start Hiking!

                It’s much better up here.  Picture yourself gazing at the amazing views of the surrounding mountain vistas as you scale your way along a cliffside.  Your heart will be pounding as you navigate from one iron rung to the other, cross a variety of suspended bridges, and zipline among the treetops.

                I simply can't imagine a better way to immerse yourself in the life of a region, to explore hidden corners and appreciate nuances while enjoying the benefits and enormous satisfaction of traveling under your own power. These are experiences you cannot have behind the wheel of a car, or on a train or a tour bus. Active travel is, at its heart, a way of connecting more authentically with the world.
